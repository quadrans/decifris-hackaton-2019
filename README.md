## "Food, Health & Sustainability"

De Componendis Cifris organizes a Smart Contract Hackathon 2019. The aim of this event is to help those
looking to kickstart effort into programming smart contracts using Solidity. Focused on building smart contract
applications, the event is a one day 4-person (max) team competition and it has a prize pool of € 6000,
provided by Quadrans Foundation and Athilab srl. Two projects will be rewarded (€ 3000 each).
The hackathon will be open to all who have an interest in Blockchain and Smart Contracts, students but not
only, though on a first-come first-served basis (places are limited).
The event will be hosted by Department of Computer Science @UniMi (Aula Magna A.Bertoni, Via Celoria
18, Milano), Department of Mathematics @UniTn and FBK (Sala Consiglio, Via Sommarive 18, Povo, Trento).
